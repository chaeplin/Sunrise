Arduino Sunrise Sunset Library
By ANDRÉ GONÇALVES | Published: JANUARY 16, 2010
Here’s an arduino library to calculate sunrise and sunset times based on date and latitude / longitude, i didn’t made the library, i took it from this website that doesn’t seem to work anymore: http://www.swfltek.com/arduino/sunrise
I’d like to give credit to the one who wrote it but i couldn’t find a creator name or contact anywhere!
i used it for my new “PS. I Love You” piece and incorporated a Noon function which returns the time when the sun is in mid sky.
Example included.

thanks Michael for your comment!
so full credits of the library goes to Michael Rice
and here’s the working link that i thought it was broken:
